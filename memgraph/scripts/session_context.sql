-- session_context.sql
--
-- Pure-SQL session-startup context for the memgraph skill.
-- No embedding call. Safe to run from startup integration without OPENAI_API_KEY.
--
-- The wrapper's `session-context` command renders this in a
-- compact text form; you can also dot-run this file directly via sqlite3
-- to get the raw rows.
