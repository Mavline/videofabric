-- recall_hybrid.sql
--
-- Reciprocal Rank Fusion over sqlite-vec (FLOAT[512]) and FTS5 (memory_fts).
-- Parameters (must be pre-bound):
--   :query_embedding  — JSON string '[0.1, -0.2, ...]' of exactly 512 floats
--   :fts_query        — FTS5 MATCH string, already tokenized/escaped
--   :vec_k            — integer; sqlite-vec requires an explicit k for the
--                        KNN MATCH. Pass a value large enough to cover the
--                        whole memory_vec row count when you want "all".
--
-- The wrapper's `recall` command does the tokenization, calls
-- embed.py for :query_embedding, and runs this template. Prefer that.
--
-- If you run this file standalone: first load sqlite-vec
--   .load /path/to/vec0.dylib
-- and bind parameters via sqlite3's `-param` flag or `.param set`.
